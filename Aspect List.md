Aspects of reality can be categorized a number of different ways: the most salient to the aspiring archmage is categorization according to degree of complexity, commonly referred to as an aspect's "order."

Though aspects in general resist easy analysis, common experience among mages associated with the Academy has allowed for a shorthand to develop, sorting aspects into groups roughly delineated by complexity, ease of adaptation, and transferable understanding. Aspects of the first order are fundamental to a magic users understanding of the world and require little to no prerequisite knowledge or experience - with few exceptions. More complex aspects of the second order and beyond extend this understanding and benefit greatly from knowledge of more primary aspects, though it is technically possible for young wizards with enough skill and comprehension to start with later aspects.
