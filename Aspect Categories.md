Many different viewpoints exist as the proper grouping of aspects. This is made especially relevant due to the fact that some aspects are naturally easier to comprehend than others, and furthermore by the fact that understanding and acquiring an aspect often makes the acquisition of related aspects much easier. The difficulty in constructing a "proper" universal set of categories is that the exact nature of this relation is different from culture to culture and, to a lesser extent, from wizard to wizard. This affects how individuals learn aspects, the order in which they progress through aspect acquisition, and even how they understand themselves and their peers.
