In Wizard Fight!, characters can range from reclusive monks in secluded mountain sects to sword-and-board battle mages fighting on the streets of crowded cities. In order to create your character, players and Game Masters – GMs for short – decide on an initial "budget" of progression points for characters to begin with. These progression points represent how far characters have traveled on their magical journeys: creating a novice studying at the Imperial Academy might only require 50 points, while an experienced researcher of mind magic might take 250 or more to fully realize. 

As characters progress along their own paths through the arcane arts, they naturally accrue additional progression points. Regardless of their source, players may spend progression points to unlock additional skills, increase their characters' basic attributes, learn spells, improve their proficiency in martial arts, and more. Typically players will receive around 5 progression points per encounter at the beginning of their journey and an increasing amount as they advance, but this number may vary widely between groups and settings. 

### Attributes
All Characters have ten basic attributes which summarize the scope of their capabilities: four of the Body, four of the Mind, and two of Magic.

#### MIND
Focus - offensive spellcasting resource, maintain concentration despite distraction, 
Willpower - ability to resist mental effects, defend against spell attacks
Acumen - mental reaction and calculation speed, 
Intuition - come to conclusions and make connections

#### BODY
Strength - move large objects and apply great force
Endurance - defensive physical resource
Dexterity - pick locks, wield weapons with finesse, play instruments
Agility - move your body with speed and grace

#### MAGIC
Resonance - connect to the world around you, align with concepts
Coherence - 

Characters begin with a score of 5 in each of these ten attributes, and may increase this score my spending a number of progression points corresponding to the new score: increasing Strength from 5 to 6 requires 6 progression points.



During character creation, players build characters by choosing an initial [[Martial Style]], picking the first rank of any two [[Skill List|Skill Paths]], and unlocking access to a [[Node]] of the player's choice.
