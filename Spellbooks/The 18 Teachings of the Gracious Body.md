For members of the Tonsekaya Mountain Sect, magic is a tool used to bring the self into alignment with the greater world. Taught alongside philosophy, ethics, martial arts, and woodlore, Outer Sect initiates learn a mantra designed to uplift the utterer and form a connection between the mind, the body, and the soul. More advanced initiates and Inner Sect disciples learn to enhance this connection within themselves and to extend it through the world around them.
