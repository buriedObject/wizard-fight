Wizard Fight! is an RPG designed to facilitate creative problem-solving and tactical magic combat while emphasizing character customization. The ruleset (hereafter designated the "System") does so by doing away with traditional RPG classes entirely—instead, character creation and progression takes inspiration from progression fantasy and xianxia novels. 

Character progression is structured into 5 distinct and successive stages, each of which represents a qualitative difference in characters' spiritual and magical capability. Players may "level up" a number of times (traditionally 10) within any given stage and receive corresponding "[[Progression Points]]." 

Importantly, any character can learn to do (almost) anything, provided they meet necessary prerequisites (exceeding a minimum [[Character Attribute]] requirement, having access to the right [[Aspect]], sufficient training in a [[Fighting Style]], etc). There are some specific exceptions—enough progression down one path might close off another (e.g. the [[Weird-Rigor Dichotomy]])—but these exceptions are uncommon and clearly marked.



What the system seeks to offer:
* Flexible, tactical combat
* Player freedom in [[Character Creation]]
* The ability to do a bunch of cool wizard stuff

What the system does NOT offer:
* The ability to be a martial fighter without magic
*
