When ancient cultures first stumbled upon the effects of magic, long before history began, they must have been at turns amazed and terrified of the spectacular displays that can result from even a toddling, untrained magician. Without a proper framework of understanding, however, deep progression into the breadth of the arcane arts is impossible for the individual spellcaster. Divorced from the modern theoretical advances that allow studious wizards to acquire mastery over an indefinite number of aspects and spell structures, ancient magicians generally lacked variety and flexibility. Perhaps the most prodigious among them managed through long effort and careful meditation to massage their souls into such an arrangement that they could master three or even four closely related elemental aspects â€” today's students of the Royal Academy boast a resonant affinity for at least three first-order aspects by the time they enter their second year of schooling.




As those with the inclination may follow their natural instincts and develop within themselves a unique style distinct from any other person save the very like-minded. From this observation we may suggest a model for early developments in magical theory without historical evidence: as more individuals became aware of the latent potential within themselves to complete magical workings, groups of spellcasters with similar affinities began to congregate. Common perception of the nature of magic at this point is unclear, of course, but from what we can glean revolved around the concept of group-based elemental alignment and progression through a series of first and second ordered aspects
