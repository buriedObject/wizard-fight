potential categories:
**aspect**
range
duration/length of casting process
danger/potential harm
effects
manifestation (projectile, aura, area, etc.)

e.g. Harry Potter spell categories derived broadly by distinct areas of study and applications (transfiguration vs charms), by target/subject (animal to animal transfiguration, human transfiguration, etc) and by degree of harm (jinx, hex, curse are offensive charms sorted by increasing minimal damage done to opponent)

D&D “schools” of magic divide a large list of spells by a mixture of intent and domain - Abjuration in 5e, e.g., contains spells like _healing word_ and _shield_ alongside spells like _banishment_ and _arcane lock_ - themed around “preventing actions and undoing harm,” these spells share a category despite their vastly different effects and manifestations.



how to categorize spells?
let's take a few simple spells and see what distinctions seem useful in particular contexts:

Flame Slash
The caster slashes with open palm and the spell creates a wide arc of flame following the motion. Range and temperature vary according to caster's Coherence and their proficiency with the spell and aspect.


Earth Wall
The caster places both hands on the ground and the spell creates a wall of earth extending from a connected surface. Size, range, and thickness vary according to Coherence and proficiency.


Puddle Jump
The caster can submerge themself within any pool of water that is big enough around to fit their body - depth is inconsequential. After doing so, the caster can emerge from any "connected" pool of water within a certain range. Range increases according to Coherence and definition of "connected" varies according to proficiency and Resonance.
