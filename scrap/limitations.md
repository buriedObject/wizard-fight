I don't like spell slots, but how to prevent players from spamming their most destructive spells over and over again?


Pool of essentially mana points tied to character's Focus stat, flavor-wise something like requiring focus to prevent yourself from getting lost in the magic, taken over by the spell's aspects?

Maybe ramping Focus costs as spells are cast in succession?

Focus: 3 (+2)
FP cost: 3 (+2)
