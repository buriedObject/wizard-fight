#### WF - brainstorm (2/2/25)
time magic

conjuration of weapon

atrributes cost (2 x new value) points - e.g., bringing Strength from 9 -> 10 would cost 20 points, and bringing Intuition from 2 -> 3 would cost 6

three main paths to illusion - direct perceptual manipulation, light/sound manipulation to create the appearance of things, and object enchaxntment

mental manipulation - evocative and invocative 


need to nail down the different ordered aspects - 



cluster for direct manipulation of living things - part biomancy (for healers?), part mental manipulation (for illusionists)

illusionists experience "the ghost” : a semi-transparent representation of the illusion experienced by the victim
  

“precise aether manipulation” - choose one diffuse aspect to gain Mastery over, further discount on “diffuse” aspects?


NO investigate -> deduction skill, OR divination

“investigation” skill path - deduce! hunch! analyze! disregard!

- you recall one observation and the GM draws your attention to a related fact or observation
- you put forth three theories and the GM informs you which is the least correct
- you put forth three theories and the GM ranks them in order from most to least likely

skill tomes? players have to have read books to gain Knowledge which can be used in applicable situations

e.g. knowledge skill: plant lore 1, source: Belfyndar’s Botanical Compendoum, vol. 1



advancement requires an Epiphany - a fundamental, subjective insight into either oneself or the world which effects one’s outlook going forward. once past the advancement threshold, players inform the GM what they want their character’s epiphany to be, and the GM works an opportunity for this into the campaign. this epiphany should broadly relate to the character’s overall mental, emotional, spiritual, or physical development throughout their journey. for example, a player whose character has struggled with violence might describe their Epiphany as “there is never an excuse for violence, but sometimes there is no choice” and advance a few sessions later after a boss battle with an ancient evil. a character with a strong righteous bent might realize “i cannot decide what is good and what is evil” after being betrayed by a friendly NPC. sometimes an Epiphany is strongly negative, or entirely introspective: “i am a coward”. sometimes an Epiphany is very positive, or tinged with altruism: “i am stronger than i think i am, and i owe it myself to use that strength to protect the people around me.” the player should be the one to come up with the epiphany, while the GM should be the one to decide how that epiphany is reached. of course, the player and GM should communicate and make sure they are on the same page regarding the stakes, nature, and tone of the epiphany: it sucks when a player seeking a light-hearted resolution to their current character arc wanted their character to realize that “no good deed goes unpunished” and the GM took that to mean “everyone in this world is selfish and will take ruthless advantage of your generosity.” at the same time, if the players and GM have decided to engage in a gritty, high-stakes campaign about war and suffering, then the player should know better than to expect something like “nothing bad ever happens to good people” to pass muster.

flip wizard! dumping points into agility, skill path for flipping around? upping Dodge and Evasion


search cantrip?

- unindexed lookup - e.g. searching for occurrences of a search term in any book in this aisle of a library


diabolists summon a demon that demon has an Obscurity Score defining how well known it is, the better known the more likely it is to be identified easily. also separate score for how common its effects are? and separate for how powerful it is, and separate for how easy it is to deal with


sympathetic magic - aligning oneself conceptually with an aspect and drawing on that resonance to work magic

ritual magic

different schools of magic

- elementalism, using aspects from the elemental cluster

optional rule - personal incantation

different people use different verbal incantations for the same spell!



#### WF - spellbooks (2/2/25)
while individual spells are defined by aspect and complexity, spells as a whole are generally sorted into groups referred to as “spellbooks” - whether those are actual books, scrolls, lists maintained by oral tradition, or other more exotic arrays.

SPELLBOOKS

- Textbooks from the Royal Academy, sorted by course

- these spells are often more formulaic and generic - a “magic missile” equivalent for each of the main elemental aspects, attacks that deal a set amount of damage, basic bread and butter spells

- Notebooks or logs kept by inventors, mad spell crafters, and traveling sages
- Domain specific spell books used by professionals and guild members

- Miners who use substance-based farsight divination spells to prospect for valuable ores
- Assassins and thieves
- Firefighters

#### WF - elemental cluster (9/13/24)
fire - lava

this cluster is part of the material (opposed to force based aspects) even though fire isn’t really a material
