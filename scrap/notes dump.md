#### WF - nature of magic dump
i want to develop more spells not linked to specific aspectual concerns - things like the Ajax shield or Sumerian cutting curse - new type - Attack? or aspect - Harm? Defense? under umbrella of Conceptual Cluster or smth?

!!!!! iMPOIRTANT

different clusters work differently according to the same laws of magic

elemental cluster - magic user aligns their soul/psyche with elemental aspects using imagery and emotional manipulation/control. due to law of similarity, doing so creates effects analogous to the elements themselves


there are MANY other avenues to creating and manipulating magical effects - even the elemental approach, though historically fundamental, has since been supplemented and expanded upon using some of these other approaches. spellforms and runic templates allow for types to give more structure to spellcasting, and centuries of repetition of common spells have worn the patterns of these workings into the world.

why is this necessary? because doing divination trhough clunky "Future" aspected spells of the same form as elemental spells SUCKS



 some examples outside of aspect + type construction
spellform + will (for example knowledge type cantrips), unaspected application of will, manipulation of laws of contagion and similarity (voodoo doll, lock of hair love spells), theories of correspondence and alchemical solutions, PERFECT HOMUNCULUS FROM BLOOD CREST, 





to make effects seem more magical apply non sequitur sensory details - wards breaking sound like shattering glass, incandescent bolt of light that leaves its own inverse behind, smell of falling snow





barrier ward that reverses personal timeline on intrusion
#### WF - point of magic dump
magic allows for a much greater and more extreme spectrum of personal expression and identity among its users

sociological lens: magic reflects and in many cases amplifies pre-existing conflicts and tension.

additionally properties/traits of spells besides type or aspect - is it sustained? reactive? offensive/defensive (is categorizing this possible or useful? if so - according to minimal harm?)


animating a swarm of rocks to orbit the caster and intercept projectile spells automatically


what is WF about?

WF is about the joy and intricacies of magic - the thrill of winning a wizard’s  duel by the skin of your teeth, poring over arcane tomes to extract the knowledge within, learning spells and mastering them with experience and practice, slowly coming to command the world around you!

  

what is the intended play experience?

players should have access to granular character options and diverse abilities (without being shoehorned into classes or archetypes) that allow them to pilot characters through journeys and adventures into worlds of magic and intrigue. large emphasis on creative problem solving and intelligent, empathetic gameplay!

  

what are the design goals to fulfill that intended play experience?
#### WF - type dump
spells by default affect the soul of the caster - a mantra works only on the person casting it unless otherwise noted by assigning an additional type like area or target.


mantra - self buff

mantra, area - e.g. gradually drain the vital energy out of all things within a 3 meter sphere

mantra, target - ally buff or enemy debuff


a curse is a spell that remains indefinitely after casting, contains its own intelligence (sapience? sentience?), and works through the law of contagion to continue its active effects both on the target and everything the target comes into contact with. technically, a curse could enact positive effect, but generally this is much more expensive than a negative effect.

  

sympathetic magic
Law of Contagion
Law of Similarity
Theory of Correspondence

  
personal ward against target spells with hostile intentions?

  



area - create a 1 meter cube of fire

knowledge - sense all flames within 100 meters

binding - whenever object A is lit on fire, object B will spontaneously combust

curse - burn all the food they cook

farsight - grant the caster thermal vision

mantra - caster gains increasing immunity to heat and hands grow hotter and hotter

projectile - create a ball of fire and launch it in a direction

spell chain - summon fire in the shape of a tree, create a grove of flaming trees, summon fiery hounds from within the grove

target - create a pillar of fire that follows the target until extinguished

ward - set intruder on fire



my body is a temple! add back in ramping xd4 effect


caster must complete a spell chain without interruption or else face backlash depending on the chain

add some kind of sustain/concentration type? or just note in spell?

#### WF - brainstorm (2/2/25)
time magic

conjuration of weapon

atrributes cost (2 x new value) points - e.g., bringing Strength from 9 -> 10 would cost 20 points, and bringing Intuition from 2 -> 3 would cost 6

three main paths to illusion - direct perceptual manipulation, light/sound manipulation to create the appearance of things, and object enchaxntment

mental manipulation - evocative and invocative 


need to nail down the different ordered aspects - 



cluster for direct manipulation of living things - part biomancy (for healers?), part mental manipulation (for illusionists)

illusionists experience "the ghost” : a semi-transparent representation of the illusion experienced by the victim
  

“precise aether manipulation” - choose one diffuse aspect to gain Mastery over, further discount on “diffuse” aspects?


NO investigate -> deduction skill, OR divination

“investigation” skill path - deduce! hunch! analyze! disregard!

- you recall one observation and the GM draws your attention to a related fact or observation
- you put forth three theories and the GM informs you which is the least correct
- you put forth three theories and the GM ranks them in order from most to least likely

skill tomes? players have to have read books to gain Knowledge which can be used in applicable situations

e.g. knowledge skill: plant lore 1, source: Belfyndar’s Botanical Compendoum, vol. 1



advancement requires an Epiphany - a fundamental, subjective insight into either oneself or the world which effects one’s outlook going forward. once past the advancement threshold, players inform the GM what they want their character’s epiphany to be, and the GM works an opportunity for this into the campaign. this epiphany should broadly relate to the character’s overall mental, emotional, spiritual, or physical development throughout their journey. for example, a player whose character has struggled with violence might describe their Epiphany as “there is never an excuse for violence, but sometimes there is no choice” and advance a few sessions later after a boss battle with an ancient evil. a character with a strong righteous bent might realize “i cannot decide what is good and what is evil” after being betrayed by a friendly NPC. sometimes an Epiphany is strongly negative, or entirely introspective: “i am a coward”. sometimes an Epiphany is very positive, or tinged with altruism: “i am stronger than i think i am, and i owe it myself to use that strength to protect the people around me.” the player should be the one to come up with the epiphany, while the GM should be the one to decide how that epiphany is reached. of course, the player and GM should communicate and make sure they are on the same page regarding the stakes, nature, and tone of the epiphany: it sucks when a player seeking a light-hearted resolution to their current character arc wanted their character to realize that “no good deed goes unpunished” and the GM took that to mean “everyone in this world is selfish and will take ruthless advantage of your generosity.” at the same time, if the players and GM have decided to engage in a gritty, high-stakes campaign about war and suffering, then the player should know better than to expect something like “nothing bad ever happens to good people” to pass muster.

diabolists summon a demon that demon has an Obscurity Score defining how well known it is, the better known the more likely it is to be identified easily. also separate score for how common its effects are? and separate for how powerful it is, and separate for how easy it is to deal with


sympathetic magic - aligning oneself conceptually with an aspect and drawing on that resonance to work magic

ritual magic

different schools of magic

- elementalism, using aspects from the elemental cluster

optional rule - personal incantation

different people use different verbal incantations for the same spell!



#### WF - spellbooks (2/2/25)
while individual spells are defined by aspect and complexity, spells as a whole are generally sorted into groups referred to as “spellbooks” - whether those are actual books, scrolls, lists maintained by oral tradition, or other more exotic arrays.

SPELLBOOKS
- Textbooks from the Royal Academy, sorted by course
	- these spells are often more formulaic and generic - a “magic missile” equivalent for each of the main elemental aspects, attacks that deal a set amount of damage, basic bread and butter spells
- Notebooks or logs kept by inventors, mad spell crafters, and traveling sages
- Domain specific spell books used by professionals and guild members
	- Miners who use substance-based farsight divination spells to prospect for valuable ores
	- Assassins and thieves
	- Firefighters
